# MSFT-AzureEventGrid
As of 16-8-2017 the public preview of Azure Event Grid is live. Azure Event Grid is a fully-managed event routing service. Azure Event Grid greatly simplifies the development of event-based applications and simplifies the creation of serverless workflows. Using a single service, Azure Event Grid manages all routing of events from any source, to any destination, for any application.

This project contains a sample for sending custom events and receiving those events (publisher application and subscribing application).
